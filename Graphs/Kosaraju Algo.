Following is Kosaraju’s DFS based simple algorithm that does two DFS traversals of graph:
1) Initialize all vertices as not visited.

2) Do a DFS traversal of graph starting from any arbitrary vertex v. If DFS traversal doesn’t visit all vertices, then return false.

3) Reverse all arcs (or find transpose or reverse of graph)

4) Mark all vertices as not-visited in reversed graph.

5) Do a DFS traversal of reversed graph starting from same vertex v (Same as step 2). If DFS traversal doesn’t visit all vertices, then return false. Otherwise return true.
