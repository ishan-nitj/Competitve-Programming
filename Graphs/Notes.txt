A node a is a ancestor of another node b in DFS if a is ancestor of b in DFS tree.

To mark arrival and departure time in DFS,use the same global variable.

A DFS tree represents the tree edges of a graph.
 
Cycle detection using DFS in undirected graphs:
For every visited vertex ‘v’, if there is an adjacent ‘u’ such that u is already visited and u is not parent of v, then there is a cycle in graph. Such an edge is 
called a back edge.An undirected graph can only have tree and back edges.

How to check whether a node is a part of cycle in a directed graph?
Start DFS from that node. If there is a back edge to that node, the node is a part of a cycle.

Cycle detection using DFS in directed graphs:
If there exists back edge in a graph , then there is cycle.Use definition of back edge as given in notes.

Classification of edges into 4 categories for directed graphs.Note that this concept of labeling edges is relative  and depends on the from where we start DFS.

NO back edge=>NO cycle
Back edge =>cycle.(holds good for both directed and undirected graphs) 

If we sort the vertices in decreasing order of their finish times of DCG, there can be an edge from right to left.If not ,then the graph would be acyclic.

Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. 
Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.(sort the vertices in decreasing order of their finish times to get  topologicla sort of the
graph.)

**If there is no vertex with in-degree 0,then there is a cycle in digraph.

It is easy to see that the first vertex can be any vertex which does not use any incoming edges and it must exist at least one such vertex, 
because DAGs do not have directed cycles. If we pick any such vertex, put it in the resulting order, and delete it from the graph, the resulting graph will remain a 
DAG and we can continue this process while the graph has at least one vertex.(Slow)

We can count the no of connected components in a graph using DFS.

We can use flyod warshall to detect which nodes form part of negative cycle in a graph.See notes.

Notes from MIT lectures:

Lec-15 Shortest paths
1)In general E=O(V^2)
Dijkstra :Complexity -O(E+VLGV) Works for only positive edges.
Bellman Ford:-O(VE) Works for both positive and negative edges.
Shortest path problem:
Find the shortest path b/w different vertices.Note that there are exponential no of paths b./w two different vertices.Note that weight does not figure in the complexity calculations of these shortest path problems.

2)Disclaimer:delta(u,v) is the length of shortest path b/w vertices u and v.
If(u==v) delta(u,v)=0
If(u and v are not connected) delta(u,v)=infinity
pi(v) is the predecessor of v in the shortest path sequence.pi(s) =Nil where s is the source vertex.

3)We can also use relative shifting of weights in case of negative weights and use Dijkstra.
Notion of negative wts:Negative tolls.

4)In case there are negative cycles, there may be some points use delta value is -infinity.See lec15 Time:35.00.So it means bellman ford algo has to determine cycles of negative edge length.

5)General Idea:
Let d(v) denote the current min. distance to v.
if(d(v)>d(u)+w(u,v)) // we have found a more shorter path.
pi(v)=u

**6)Subpaths of a shortest paths are also shortest path.
