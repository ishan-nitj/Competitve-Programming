Here are naming conventions for Python identifiers -

Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.

Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.

Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.

If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.
